<h2>Project Brief</h2>
<body>This is a personal project that I took upon myself- an environmental app meant to help users reduce their carbon footprint. I currently work in retail, and I often see lots of unnecessary waste- repeat customers needing an unnecessary amount of bags and plastic simply out of convenience. With this app, I hoped to (in part) incentivize customers to bring reusable bags in order to redeem rewards and other perks at checkout.</body>

<p>
<h2>My Role</h2>
<body>This was an individual case study- illustrations, development, and prototyping are all done by me. I wanted to focus on developing my UI skills and illustrations for this project. I wanted to try integrating my designs together in a cohesive way that adds to the experience but doesn't take the main focus away. </body>

<h2>My Angle</h2>
<body>Working in retail shows you a lot about consumer buying habits, including the unnecessary waste that comes from plastic bags. Some customers take plastic bags when they only purchase a single pencil at checkout, and take it only for the convenience instead of thinking about the environmental impact. From my observations, consumers are mainly driven by the prospect of rewards and if rewards were given as a result of sustainable behavior, I believe that people would take more actions to act sustainably and resourcefully.  </body>
