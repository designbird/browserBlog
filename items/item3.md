<h2>Project Brief</h2>
<body>Laurier values student satisfaction higher then anything else- above all, they want their students to be happy with their choice to choose Laurier. One of the first real exposures students get to Laurier is in a digital sense: course registration for first year, which is where Laurier identified and brought forward the following issues: students are not utilizing the resources available to them, and an influx of questions being emailed to Laurier that are already answered in the guide.</body>

<h2>My Role</h2>
<body>This was a team project, and was my first experience collaborating with other designers as well as being my first ever UX project! I helped to conceptualize our idea, design the prototype, and I presented the idea to our client (Laurier) along with my fellow teammate, Emily Xiao. </body>

<h2>My Angle</h2>
<body>This was an important project because it directly affected students like ourselves. The changes we implemented were created from a user-centric position, as we also represent the users of the guide. I really think that having clean and clear design for something like the registration guide is vital to having an easy experience, especially as a first-time university student, and we took those values and applied them while designing our solution. </body>
