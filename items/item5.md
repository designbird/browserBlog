<h2>My Role</h2>
<body>This highlight is intended to showcase my developing illustration skills. As a designer, I think it's important to have skills across various areas of design, and since I have an interest in Illustration, I figured I would try and develop my skills. I use Procreate on my iPad to sketch out and create my designs, and I practice as much as possible and upload them to my Dribbble account, so I'm able to track my progress. </body>

<h2>My Angle</h2>
<body>I think Illustration is very powerful when coupled with good design. It helps draw users in to the interface, and makes the experience more compelling. In portfolios and case studies, it helps to tell a story and convey the meaning and impact on users. There are lots of great illustration resources online, but I think holding the skill for yourself is beneficial for crafting experiences that are true to your experience and needs.      </body>
