<h2>Project Brief</h2>
<body>This design was created for my Interaction Design class. Weekly, we are tasked with taking an old design and redesigning it to be more effective and to resolve an issue with the original. For this design, our group decided to tackle Discord, and focused on the voice call join process. All you need to do to join a voice call is click on the icon, which blends in with the surrounding chat interface. We decided to redesign it in order to reduce the chances of users accidentally choosing it.  </body>

<h2>My Role</h2>
<body>This was part of a team project, so we collaborated across ideating and pulling together our presentation. I was in charge of creating the actual prototype that week, so I designed the image you see above in Sketch as a result of our team discussions and opinions.  </body>

<h2>My Angle</h2>
<body>I personally have accidentally joined Discord calls without realizing it because of how the interface is blended together, and it freaked me out at the time because I wasn't at all used to the interface or any of its functions. Now, I'm very conscious when navigating Discord to make sure I don't accidentally join anything. I think this design will help new users become more comfortable with the interface and less likely to make any accidental slips.    </body>
